# Introduction to command-line tools

You should've gone through the first part of [setting-up](https://github.com/utdata/icj-setting-up) before starting this lesson.

This lesson is a beginner's guide to using command-line tools for coding and data-journalism. It is designed for students who may have never used Terminal before. It is geared toward Macs, but Windows users should be able to follow along if they use Git BASH, which should be installed with the [git Windows installer](https://git-scm.com/download/).
