# Introduction to command-line interface tools

This lesson is a beginner's guide to using a command-line interface tools for coding and data-journalism. It is designed for students who may have never used Terminal before but are taking my [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class) class.

I use a Mac, and there are some differences for Windows users. The first major difference is Windows users have to install Git (and Git Bash, which comes with it) before we can go much further.

- Windows users [install Git](https://github.com/utdata/icj-setting-up/blob/master/windows-01.md) and then return here. There will be a link telling you when to come back here.
